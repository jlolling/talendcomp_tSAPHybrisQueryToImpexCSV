# Talend Components tSAPHybrisHac*
Talend Components to read and write data to SAP Hybris E-Commerce Platform via the Hybris Admin Console

Hybris projects needs to implement there own data exchange interfaces.
Out-of-the-box the Hybris Admin Console (HAC) is the possibility to exchange data.

The HAC is a core part of Hybris and always present.
But the HAC only provides a web formular to read/write data.
To automate such actions Klaus Hausschild has created his well known project jhac:
https://github.com/klaushauschild1984/jhac

The Talend components uses this project to provide a convient Talend component to read/write data to Hybris.
At the moment only the read part is implmented: tSAPHybrisHacFlexibleSearch

Flexible Search is the query language of Hybris:

## Component tSAPHybrisHacFlexibleSearch
This component reads data from Hybris defined by a Flexible Search query (see doc above).

The component connects to the HAC and executes the given query.
The component also translates the names from the Talend schema into the technical field names returned by the query.

![Here an simple example job](https://github.com/xommaterials/talendcomp_tHybrisHac/blob/master/doc/tSAPHybrisHacFlexibleSearch_example_job_design.png)
The HAC returns the result fields in case of there is no alias always in lower case with prefix "p_".
If a alias is given it the result field will named axactly like the alias.
The component tests the given Talend columns and maps them to the returned query fields.
If a field cannot be mapped, the component fails with a meaningful error message.

**One important thing: The order of the fields is not important, only the names must match**
This is unlike the database components, where the order and the typ is important and the name does not matter.
